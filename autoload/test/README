This subdirectory demonstrates how to use the make-tclIndex program,
and how the auto_load facility makes programming with many .tcl files easy.

* To generate the tclIndex:

-  cd into this directory (tcl-misc/autoload/test)
-  execute ../make-tclIndex   (no arguments or --verbose)

* To execute the demo:

-  ./main.tcl   (no arguments or --slow)

main.tcl features two methods of enabling auto_load access:

-  Standard way: append the directory containing tclIndex to $auto_path
-  Fast way: directly source tclIndex  (variable $dir must be set)

If you choose the "Fast way", you don't need to alter $auto_path first,
just source the appropriate tclIndex. The "Fast way" should especially
be chosen for packages (libraries), because changing $auto_path each time
a package is loaded will lead to a performance penalty, as the contained
directories and all their sub(sub...)directories will be re-scanned for
pkgIndex.tcl files on the next [package require] command.

If you need to query from a "main application" which namespaces are defined
in the indexed script files (for example, when looking up installed plugins),
you should use the make-tclIndex-with-ns script instead of make-tclIndex.
The resulting tclIndex files have to be explicitly sourced in the "main
application", otherwise the namespaces will only be present after some
auto_load action has been triggered.
