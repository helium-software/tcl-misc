* trigsplines.tcl: Demo on Trigonometric Interpolation for drawing splines

    Is Trigonometric Interpolation (from a Numerical Methods exercise) usable
    as an alternative method for drawing curved lines in computer graphics?

    The implemented procedure treats the points as complex numbers in the
    Gaussian plane and calculates the points that constitute the interpolation
    with one FFT and one inverse FFT. As Fast Fourier Transform always works
    on complex numbers, the interpolation is not more difficult than
    interpolating a real function f(t).

    The results are rather interesting, inherently periodic (i.e. smoothly
    closed) curves (actually the trajectory of a trigonometric polynomial
    with an order approximately equal to the number of given points).
    However, they are not useful as splines in graphical design, since
    moving any control point affects the whole curve, and the curve does
    not stay near the points (=> some sense of unstability).
    It can rather be considered as a 'toy' (like the famous spirograph);
    but the interpolation of exactly three point gives an ellipse, so
    this special case might be worthwhile for drawing programs.
